# Movie-Recommendation-System-using-Python

- In this project, I developed a movie recommendation system using Python that provides personalized movie suggestions based on user preferences. The system utilizes a dataset of movies and their attributes to create a similarity-based recommendation engine. Here's an overview of the project's key steps:

- User Input:
The project begins by prompting the user to input their favorite movie. The entered movie name is stored for further processing.

- Data Preparation:
The movie titles are extracted from a dataset, which likely contains information about various movies. These titles are used to identify potential matches with the user's input.

- Finding Close Matches:
Utilizing the difflib.get_close_matches() function, the project identifies the closest match to the user's input among the movie titles. This step is crucial for handling potential typos or variations in user input.

- Index Retrieval:
The index of the closest match is retrieved from the dataset, helping to identify the selected movie within the larger context of the data.

- Calculating Similarity:
A similarity matrix, not displayed in the provided code, is previously computed. This matrix captures the similarity between movies based on various attributes. The similarity scores between the user's selected movie and all other movies are then determined.

- Sorting and Recommendation:
The similarity scores are sorted in descending order to identify the most similar movies. The project iterates through the sorted list and prints a list of recommended movies, presenting options that are most similar to the user's favorite movie.

- User Interaction:
The recommended movies are displayed to the user, providing them with a curated list of films that share characteristics with their input. This enhances the user experience and encourages further exploration.

### Overall, the project showcases my ability to manipulate data, calculate similarity, and create a simple recommendation system using Python. While the provided code snippet lacks certain details, such as the specific similarity calculation method and the dataset used, it offers a foundation for building a functional movie recommendation system. The project demonstrates my proficiency in handling data, implementing algorithms, and delivering a practical solution that can enhance user engagement and satisfaction in various applications, such as entertainment platforms.
